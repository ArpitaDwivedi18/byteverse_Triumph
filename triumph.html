                As you all know that any mall or any supermarket , sellers there fill the stocks by numerous products. When the price of the specific product is fixed,
         static or constant over the time then it is impossible to generate high revenue in that case because customers are not offered
          any flexibility in the price range because of fixed pricing strategy that leads to less customer acquisition less number 
          of customers think of buying the products this will also lead to the most of the products in the stock left unsold and
           will lead to high product wastage, eventually very less or no profit for business running people.To tackle this tradition of fixed pricing strategy we need a dynamic pricing algorithm that will
                 decide the price of the specific product by taking the input of the data like customer 
                demand for that product,events,time festivals, discounts to be offered to the customers and also keeping
                    in mind that businesses are profitable...This leads to high customer acquisition because more number of customers  will be 
                    buying the products because they are getting the flexibility in the price range, more and more products are sold,
                    no product wastage, high profitable businesses, customer satisfaction.</p>
